This is fascinating to watch.
With just the flocking turned on it does feel like little packets of energy coming together into atoms.
Because of a bug, the boids can move from one side of the canvas to the other, but if the radius of perception is below the width or height
of the canvas, then moving from one side to the other removes them from the influence of the group, and the group doesn't feel their 
influence any more.  As a result the group rarely ever fully crosses over as their is oscilations and if you remove part of the attractor
then the group changes direction.
